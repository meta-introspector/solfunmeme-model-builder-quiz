# SOP: Documentation Management

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the standards and procedures for creating and maintaining project documentation.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all documentation within this project, including the `README.md` file and all files within the `/docs` directory.

## 3. Standards

*   **Format:** All documentation should be written in GitHub Flavored Markdown.
*   **Location:** All documentation should be stored in the `/docs` directory, organized into subdirectories as needed.
*   **Clarity:** Documentation should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

## 4. Procedure

*   **`README.md`:** The root `README.md` file should serve as a high-level introduction to the project. It should provide a brief overview, instructions for getting started, and links to more detailed documentation in the `/docs` directory.
*   **Code Changes:** When you make a code change that introduces, modifies, or removes functionality, you must update the corresponding documentation in the same pull request.
*   **Review:** Documentation changes are subject to the same review process as code changes.
