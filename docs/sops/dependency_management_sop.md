## 3. Procedure

### Adding Dependencies

1.  **Evaluation:** Before adding a new dependency, evaluate its necessity, license, maintenance status, and community activity.
2.  **Approval:** The decision to add a new dependency should be discussed and approved in the relevant pull request.
3.  **Version Pinning:** Use specific versions in `Cargo.toml` to ensure reproducible builds. Avoid using `*` for version numbers.

### Updating Dependencies

1.  **Regular Updates:** Dependencies should be updated regularly to incorporate bug fixes and security patches.
2.  **Testing:** After updating dependencies, run all tests to ensure that the changes do not introduce any regressions.
3.  **Changelogs:** Review the changelogs of the updated dependencies to understand the changes.

### Removing Dependencies

If a dependency is no longer needed, it should be removed from `Cargo.toml` to reduce the project's footprint.
